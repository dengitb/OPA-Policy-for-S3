# Edge Cases and Logging/Monitoring

# Edge Cases
    . Consider scenarios where the role might be improperly formatted.
    . Ensure the policy correctly handles case sensitivity (e.g., "st-access-role" vs "ST-ACCESS-ROLE").
    . Ensure the policy is not bypassed by role impersonation.
    . Address scenarios where the required role has been deleted or renamed in the IAM system.
    . Handle dynamic changes to user roles during an active session
    . Ensure that access is denied if the user's credentials have expired.
    . Deny access for roles that have been revoked or are no longer valid.
    . Address potential conflicts where multiple policies may apply to the same resource.
    . Handle inheritance issues where roles might inherit permissions from other roles.
    . Deny access from IP addresses or geographic locations that are not trusted.
    . Ensure that access is only granted from verified devices.

# Logging and Monitoring:
    . Integrate OPA with logging tools to monitor policy enforcement and capture Capture detailed access logs including timestamps, user IDs, roles, and actions taken.
    . Use AWS CloudTrail to track IAM role activities and log events such as role changes and access attempts and validate against OPA logs.
    . Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activities or policy violations.
    . Use monitoring dashboards to provide a visual representation of policy enforcement and access trends
    . Conduct regular audits of access logs to identify and investigate anomalies.
    . Periodically review and update policies to adapt to new security requirements and threat landscapes.
    . Notify users when access is denied, including the reason for denial.
    . Inform users of changes to access policies that might affect their permissions.
